    <h1>Coffee Quality Prediction</h1>
    <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
    <p>Coffee has a rich history that spans over 1,000 years, with its origins dating back to Ethiopia. Legend has it that a goatherd named Kaldi discovered coffee when he noticed that his goats became more energetic after eating the red berries of a certain plant. From there, coffee spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and eventually to the rest of the world.</p>
    <h2>Advantages of Coffee</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Improves cognitive function</li>
        <li>Boosts energy</li>
        <li>Antioxidant properties</li>
        <li>Social benefits</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disadvantages of Coffee</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Addiction</li>
        <li>Sleep disturbance</li>
        <li>Increased heart rate and blood pressure</li>
        <li>Acidity and digestive issues</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>About Our Project: Coffee Quality Prediction using Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Our project aims to revolutionize the coffee industry by developing a machine learning model that can predict the quality of coffee beans. This innovative approach uses a combination of sensory and chemical data to evaluate the quality of coffee beans, providing a more accurate and efficient way to assess coffee quality.</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our Coffee Quality Prediction Project! Our mission is to leverage the power of machine learning to accurately predict the quality of coffee beans, helping coffee producers, buyers, and enthusiasts ensure they get the best quality coffee every time.</p>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>Our project focuses on using advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze various factors affecting coffee quality, such as bean type, growing conditions, processing methods, and sensory attributes. By training our models on extensive datasets, we aim to predict coffee quality with high precision.</p>
    <h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Accurate Predictions: Develop robust models that can predict coffee quality with high accuracy.</li>
       <li>Support Farmers: Provide insights to coffee growers to help them improve their crop quality.</li>
       <li>Educate Consumers: Help coffee buyers and enthusiasts understand the factors that contribute to high-quality coffee.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>Data Collection: We gather data from multiple sources, including coffee farms, processing centers, and sensory evaluations.</li>
       <li>Data Processing: Our team cleans and preprocesses the data to ensure it is ready for analysis.</li>
       <li>Model Development: We use various machine learning techniques, including regression and classification algorithms, to build our prediction models.</li>
       <li>Evaluation: Our models are rigorously tested and validated to ensure their reliability and accuracy.</li>
       <li>Deployment: The final models are integrated into our web platform, providing users with easy access to quality predictions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Get Involved</h2>
    <p>We welcome collaboration and feedback from the coffee community. Whether you are just a coffee lover, your insights and support are invaluable to us.</p>
